## ‚ö°Ô∏è Running this project

This is a common [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) project (with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) added as a dependency).

To run from this project, you:

-   download the ZIP archive or clone the repository;
-   navigate inside the project‚Äôs directory in the Terminal and type:

`npm install`

‚Ä¶ to reinstall the Node packages.

And then you‚Äôre ready to kick off the development server:

`npm start`

‚Ä¶ which will open the project on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Note that you must have [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

## ü§î How is the React logo animated?

In Framer Motion, you use [motion components](https://www.framer.com/motion/component/) instead of common HTML and SVG elements. The SVG with the logo contains three `<motion.path>`s (the ovals) and a `<motion.circle>` (or two) in the center.

You can animate most of an element‚Äôs attributes, and a `<motion.path>` even has a [few extra properties](https://www.framer.com/motion/component/###svg-line-drawing):

-   `pathLength`
-   `pathSpacing`
-   `pathOffset`

Here‚Äôs the first one of the ovals:

```jsx
<motion.path
    d="M 538.429 94.524 ‚Ä¶"
    initial={{
        stroke: "url(#initialColor)",
        pathLength: 1,
        pathOffset: 0,
        pathSpacing: 1,
    }}
    ref={scopeOval1}
/>
```

Framer Motion‚Äôs [`useAnimate()`](https://www.framer.com/motion/use-animate/) hook is used to run a [sequence](https://www.framer.com/motion/animate-function/##animate-sequences) of animations on the three `<motion.path>`s.

### First animation: shorten the path

The first animation shortens the path (to 5%) by changing its `pathLength`. At the same time, the `pathOffset` is moved forward so that the animation runs clockwise.

```jsx
    function sequence(scope, animate, delay = 0) {
        animate([
            [
                scope.current,
                {
                    pathLength: 0.05,
                    pathOffset: 1,
                    pathSpacing: 0.95
                },
                {
                    delay: delay,
                    duration: 1,
                    ease: "easeIn"
                }
            ],
            ‚Ä¶
```

(The change to `pathSpacing` is needed to make the dash reappear at the beginning of the path.)

### Second animation: travel along the path

Speeding the _dash_ along the path is easy: you just animate the `pathOffset`.

```jsx
            ‚Ä¶
            [
                scope.current,
                { pathOffset: [0, 1] },
                { duration: 0.5, ease: "linear" }
            ],
            [
                scope.current,
                { pathOffset: [0, 1] },
                { duration: 0.5, ease: "linear" }
            ],
            ‚Ä¶
```

This animation runs twice.

### Third animation: grow the path

Change `pathLength` to 100% to make the dash grow back to the full length of the path.

```jsx
            ‚Ä¶
            [
                scope.current,
                {
                    pathOffset: [0, 0],
                    pathSpacing: [1, 1],
                    pathLength: [0.05, 1]
                },
                { duration: 1.5, ease: "easeOut" }
            ]
        ]);
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thijsm/public/master/CRA%203.gif"/>

### The central circle

The `<motion.circle>` in the center contains the same animated gradient as the paths and rotates continuously.

```jsx
<motion.circle
    r="46"
    cx="422"
    cy="297"
    fill="url(#motionGradientAnimated)"
    animate={{ rotate: 360 }}
    transition={{
        repeat: Infinity,
        ease: "linear",
        duration: 8
    }}
/>
```

It‚Äôs only not visible initially because it‚Äôs covered by _another_ `<motion.circle>` in React blue that fades out after a [`delay`](https://www.framer.com/motion/transition/###delay).

```jsx
<motion.circle
    r="46"
    cx="422"
    cy="297"
    fill="#61dafb"
    initial={{ fillOpacity: 1 }}
    animate={{ fillOpacity: 0 }}
    transition={{
        delay: 3,
        duration: 2,
    }}
/>
```

### The gradient

Yes, the SVG `<linearGradient>` is also animated! Or rather: its `<motion.stop>`s are. Each stop runs through an array ([keyframes](https://www.framer.com/motion/examples/#keyframes)) of colors.

```jsx
<linearGradient id="motionGradientAnimated">
    <motion.stop
        offset="5%"
        animate={{
            stopColor: [
                colors.motionBlue,
                colors.motionMagenta,
                colors.motionPurple,
            ],
        }}
        transition={{
            repeat: Infinity,
            repeatType: "reverse",
            ease: "linear",
            duration: 8,
        }}
    />
    ‚Ä¶
</linearGradient>
```

### Spinning the icon

While all this happens, the whole icon spins.

That‚Äôs _not_ a Framer Motion animation. The original CRA template has a CSS @keyframes animation applied to the `<svg>`‚Äôs `App-logo` class, which I just left in.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
    .App-logo {
        animation: App-logo-spin infinite 20s linear;
    }
}

@keyframes App-logo-spin {
    from {
        transform: rotate(0deg);
    }
    to {
        transform: rotate(360deg);
    }
}
```
